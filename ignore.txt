upper portion is called kpi i.e year on year growth, spark lines
->download it from google sheets from files-> download-> excel

-> First convert the data into tables
i.e by Ctrl+T  and OK
-> We convert it in tables, so that in future if we have to enter (or add) data in the table, automatically it will go to in the range of the table and when we refresh it, our dashboard will also reflect changes(dynamically) made by the new data.

1.-> Sales and Profit analysis (combo Chart)
-> Pivot Table summarizes or aggregates the whole data

-> Click on Pivot Table, We can do the design in one worksheet only, but for systematic appraoch we will design every chart and KPI design in new Worksheet. 

-> first, we will check(tick mark) the order date
-> Now when we drill down years-> we get quarters, -> then we get months under that quarter

-> Drag the years row and the quarter row (from bottom right rows table) into the sheet.
-> now we see only the row lables in months
-> Now we search for sales in the pivotTable fields , then drag it into the values box in below right.(or you can simply tick mark it)
-> Now we search for profit in the pivotTable fields , then drag it into the values box in below right.(or you can simply tick mark it)
-> Now we'll format the data of Sum of Sales and Sum of Profit

-> First we'll keep it for two decimal points and -> well convert it to dollars e.g-> 95365.93 -> convert it to -> 95.36k in $

-> Select all the data of Sum of Sales and Sum of Profit and press ctrl+1 -> In format cells option->Custom -> and type $ 0.00, "K" (you will find it at the last next time you do any project) -> 0.00, here' , ' will convert it to K .Means it will take our pointer ahead of 3 decimals value ->"K" this is hard coded value of K, means it will display K.

-> Now we'll make Chart
-> Now click on any data (e.g. $147.08)-> above click on PivotTable Analyze-> then Pivot Chart-> Now since we have to make combo chart or dual axis chart , click on Combos
-> Since we want both to be on different axis, tick mark the secondary axis of Sum Of Profit
-> And we want the area chart, not line chart, so select the first chart of Area.-> Then Ok-> Our chart is ready.
->Now right click on any one button on the chart(E.g sum of Sales) -> Hide all field buttons on chart.
-> Name the sheet1 as Combo Chart
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.-> CategoryWise Profit (Waterfall Chart)

-> Now we'll design waterfall chart
-> Again go to Data sheet , insert-> pivot table-> new worksheet-> Ok
->Search for category and tick it or drag it to rows, then search profit and tick it or drag it to columns
-> Now click on any data-> above click on PivotTable Analyze-> then Pivot Chart-> Now since we have to make waterfall chart , click on Waterfall
_> Message came: you cant create this chart type with data inside a Pivot Table.
->so we'll have to take the data out of the pivot table.
-> Basically we have to copy it.
-> Beside the datas we already have write Category, Profit , two columns we created.
-> Below Category, type = and select the corresponding first value in the pivot table created earlier(here Furniture) + Enter -> Then slide the box below , then all values will be copied.
-> You can make the row bigger by dragging or oxtending on the corresponding column's letter (here E).
-> Again , under Profit: in the first box, type = and select the corresponding first value in the pivot table created earlier(here 18451.2728) + Enter 
->Now, if we slide the box below, all values are coming same i.e 18451.2728
-> so, for this see the formula above: for the first value under Profit column:
=GETPIVOTDATA("Profit",$A$3,"Category","Furniture")
-> Above formula is coming for all values i.e all "Furniture" values are coming in table.
-> For this, delete "Furniture" , and select the first row under category , and press enter.
-> Formula changed to :=GETPIVOTDATA("Profit",$A$3,"Category",A4)
-> similary for below values A5, A6.....etc.

->Now, if we slide the box below, all values are coming as we expected.
-> Now just delete (type delete)the A7 value i.e Grand Total value(since it is not an actual member of the field)(Grand Total is a measure calculated through Pivot Table)(It does not come from the data)
so copy it as it is hard-codedly.(i.e press =, then select the value then enter)
->Then select the total new table created, -> then insert ->in Recommended Charts there will be Waterfall Chart, select it.
->Now, since we want the grand total starting from zero, 
Right click on the grand total chart until it becomes deep blue, then click on ->Format Data Point-> checkmark the Set as Total
option.
-> Our waterfall chart is ready.
-> Now to change the number formatting of it:
you can ->either select all the numbers and press ctrl+1
-> or in Home -> In Number-> click on last small symbol-> then Custom-> then at last our own customized one will be there ($ 0.00, "K" )
-> Name the Sheet 2 as Waterfall Chart
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.-> CategoryWise Sales Share % (Pie Chart)
-> Now we'll design pie chart
-> Again go to Data sheet , insert-> pivot table-> new worksheet-> Ok -> Name it: Pie Chart
->Search for category and tick it or drag it to rows, then search sales and tick it or drag it to columns
->But, to show it in percentages, right click on any one value of Sum of Sales column.-> go to show values as -> Go to  % of Grand Total
-> Now values will be shown in percentages.
-> Now select on any data on the table, then PivotTable Analyse option will be activated (above). -> go to Pivot Chart -> Select on Pie -> At the last there is Donut, select it.->Ok-> Now hide the buttons on chart by right clicking->Hide all field buttons on chart.
->On clicking the chart, you can see a + option(chart elements), there turn on(tick) the data labels.
-> Now to increase the width of the donut, right click  on the donut area on the chart -> Go to Format Data Series -> Decrease Donut Hole Size to 62%. -> Increase the Donut Explosion(the space between the two donuts) to 1%.
-> Delete the word Total in the chart.
->Pie chart is ready, name the sheet to Pie Chart.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.-> Sales by State (Map Chart)
-> Now we'll design map chart
-> Again go to Data sheet , insert-> pivot table-> new worksheet-> Ok -> Name it: Map Chart
->Search for state and tick it or drag it to rows, then search sales and tick it or drag it to columns
-> Now select on any data on the table, then PivotTable Analyse option will be activated (above). -> go to Pivot Chart -> Select on Map -> Same Error will come. i.e we have to copy the data outside pivot table.
->So beside the pivot table, we create 2 columns, one is State, and another is Sales.
-> Below State, type = and select the corresponding first value in the pivot table created earlier(here Alabama) + Enter -> Then slide the box below , then all values will be copied.
-> You can make the row bigger by dragging or extending on the corresponding column's letter (here D).
-> Again , under Sales: in the first box, type = and select the corresponding first value in the pivot table created earlier(here 19510.64) + Enter 
->Now, if we slide the box below, all values are coming same i.e 19510.64
-> so, for this see the formula above: for the first value under Profit column:
=GETPIVOTDATA("Sales",$A$3,"State","Alabama")
-> Above formula is coming for all values i.e all "Alabama" values are coming in table.
-> For this, delete "Alabama" , and select the first row under state (*very important) , and press enter.
-> Formula changed to :=GETPIVOTDATA("Sales",$A$3,"State",A4)
-> similary for below values A5, A6.....etc.

->Now, if we slide the box below, all values are coming as we expected.
-> Now just delete (type delete)the A7 value i.e Grand Total value(since it is not an actual member of the field) (it is not required here)

->Now convert all these numbers in $ and k.
-> select all the values under Sales, click the small icon in Home-> Number-> Custom -> our customized value at last.
->Then select the total new table created, -> then insert ->in Recommended Charts there will be Waterfall Chart, select it.
-> to make map chart, Internet should be on-> It  sends the geographical data to cloud server, then match and shows the map.
-> select all the values except Grand total -> then Insert -> Maps -> Map chart
-> this will be dynamic, we can show it by bringing in Insert slicer.
-> Select on any value on Sum of Sales(any of the numeric values in the Pivot Table)-> then go to PivotTable Analyze-> then Insert Slicer-> then tick mark Year ->ok
-> Now, click on any of the year-> it will work. Why is it working?
-> It became dynamic,Since, we got(extracted) the values from the pivot table, now from the extracted values we made the map-> so they all will change, since they are interconnected.
-> (*)It worked because we did everything based on formulas.If you copy paste, slicer won't work.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.-> Top 5 Subcategories by sales ( Chart)
-> Again go to Data sheet , insert-> pivot table-> new worksheet-> Ok -> Name it: Top 5
->Search for sub-category and tick it or drag it to rows, then search sales and tick it or drag it to columns
-> Now since we have to take the Top 5, -> we have to sort it-> select any numeric value on pivot table(Sum of sales here)-> right click-> sort->Largest to Smallest
->For top 5, in the current Pivot Table, in Row Labels, click on the small icon(at last),-> go to Value Filters-> Go to Top 10 -> decrement it to 5 -> want it on the basis of(here Sum Of Sales)-> Ok
-> Now select any one numerical value from pivot table,-> go to PivotTable Analyze-> got to Pivot Chart-> go to Bar Chart-> Ok
->But we wanted the larger values at the starting , 
->so one way is : what we can do is : to reverse.
->Another way is: But here we will select a numerical value from pivot table, -> right click on it->sort->sort smallest to largest.(Jugaad)
-> we got the values as we wanted-> Now hide the buttons from the chart,by right clicking on it and remove any texts in the chart(here Total). 
-> Completed all the charts
-------------------------------------------------------------
->Now we'll design the KPI's
-> Again go to Data sheet , insert-> pivot table-> new worksheet-> Ok -> Name it: KPI
->Search for order date and tick it or drag it to rows, but since i want only the months, so well drag the years and quarters onto the sheet. -> then search sales and tick it or drag it to columns
->Then select a numeric value -> go to PivotTable Analyze->then Pivot Chart-> Line-> Ok-> Then remove all things from the chart , only to get the line(Like Sparkline).(then make it small)
-> now it behaves just like a Sparkline-> (here) according to the months this is the sales sparkline.
-> But to make an actual sparkline, select all the numeric values(here Sum of Sales) except the Grand Total values, ->then Insert->  then above go to Line-> give the location where you want to make the sparkline->Ok.
-> To bold the actual sparkline, select the sparkline, -> got to sparkline, ->then sparkline colour->then Weight-> then Select-> Ok
-> Since, the quality becoming very low, when using in dashboard,we are not using the actual Spark lines.
-----------------------------
->Copy paste the values for another sparkline,but instead of Sum of Sales, We want profits.
-> For that, select any numeric value of the table(copied one),-> Go to PivotTable Analyze-> A the top right select Field List.
-> Remove the Sum of Sales to the sheet and tick mark the Profit or drag it down to the values table.
->Then select a numeric value -> go to PivotTable Analyze->then Pivot Chart-> Line-> Ok-> Then remove all things from the chart , only to get the line(Like Sparkline).(then make it small)
----------------------------
->Copy paste the values for another sparkline,but instead of Sum of Sales, We want quantity.
-> For that, select any numeric value of the table(copied one),-> Go to PivotTable Analyze-> A the top right select Field List.
-> Remove the Sum of Profits to the sheet and tick mark the Quantity or drag it down to the values table.
->Then select a numeric value -> go to PivotTable Analyze->then Pivot Chart-> Line-> Ok-> Then remove all things from the chart , only to get the line(Like Sparkline).(then make it small)
------------------------------
->Copy paste the values for another sparkline,but instead of Sum of Sales, We want OrderID.
-> For that, select any numeric value of the table(copied one),-> Go to PivotTable Analyze-> A the top right select Field List.
-> Remove the Sum of Quantity to the sheet and tick mark the Order ID or drag it down to the values table.
->Then select a numeric value -> go to PivotTable Analyze->then Pivot Chart-> Line-> Ok-> Then remove all things from the chart , only to get the line(Like Sparkline).(then make it small)
------------------------------
-> Now we'll have to calculate Profit Margin, now it is not in our data coz we'll have to calculate it, then add to our data, then have to make the sparkline.
-> Firstly,Copy paste the values for another sparkline,but instead of Count of Order ID, We want Profit Margin.
-> For that, select any numeric value of the table(copied one),-> Go to PivotTable Analyze-> A the top right select Field List.
-> Remove the Count of Order ID to the sheet 
->Profit Margin Formula:
Sum of profit / Sum Of Sales
-> To introduce the formula, click on any value on the (newly copied table)-> Go to PivotTable Analyze->go to Fields, Items & sets -> then  Calculation Field.
-> Give the name of the field:
Profit Margin
Formula:
= Profit/Sales -> OK

->Then select a numeric value -> go to PivotTable Analyze->then Pivot Chart-> Line-> Ok-> Then remove all things from the chart , only to get the line(Like Sparkline).(then make it small)
------------------------------------------------------------
-> The less Pivot Charts we use , more the Performance of our Dashboard.->Since when we click on the filters(Slicers) and apply on the pivot charts, it takes time to filter the data on the pivot charts, so it reduces the Performance of the Dashboard.
-> So to increase the Performance of Pivot Charts, we should use mini-mum use of Pivot Charts.
------------------------------------------------------------
-> Now, we got 5 grand total values from each table, from each Grand Total we have to take it's value out(copy) of the pivot table, by = then, selecting the grand total value, then ok.
-> WE took the value outside, like that because, Firstly, it will stay dynamic, if we take it outside by formula,(by if we copy paste, it won't work) since it's a shape and we will the kpi inside the shape.
-> the shape doesn't recognize the values from pivot table, so we took the value outside.
->So, take out all the Grand Total values one by one from the Pivot Table. 

-> Now we need to change the currency to Dollar in each of the taken out values from Pivot Table.
-> For that, select the value, either press ctrl+1 or you can see above in Home->in the Number Box-> Under General or Acounting-> first option $ sign.-> Select $ (English United States)
->And decimal points should be two.-> For that, in Number box-> Under Accounting at the last there is option to increase or decrease decimal points.
------------------------------
-> For quantity, there are not Measured in Dollars, for this we'll have to add the # sign.
-> For that either Ctrl +1, or under Number Box press the small icon, to set custom value->select 0-> then type->
"#" 0-> Ok
-> Similary do it for Order ID.
-> for Profit Margin,we calculate it in Percentage, -> under Number-> there is % sign click it -> then for upto two digit decimal points, click on the option to increase or decrease decimal points.
------------------------------------------------------------
-> Now, well take out the YOY growth in Coloured Combinations.
-> Got to Data sheet-> Insert->New pivot Table-> Ok-> Name the sheet as KPI YOY.  
->In Pivot Table Fields-> Tick the YEARS (at the last)(since it's a automatically generated field by excel according to date fields )(dont tick the YEAR one)-> Then Tick on Sales->Then Tick On Profit-> then Take Quantity->Then for Order ID , take it and drag it(don't tick mark it) to the values box below, at the last. (Since Order ID is a Alphanumeric VAlue, it is treated as a dimension. So, to convert it to Quantity , we will drag it to values)
-> Then tick mark on Profit Margin.
-> So now, we don't want the Grand Totals,in this KPI YOY sheet, so right click on any one of the numeric values of Grand Total -> Pivot TAble Options -> Total & Filters ->Uncheck both the boxes containing: Show grand totals for rows and Show grand totals for columns.-> Ok
-----------------------------
->YOY growth is according to the previous year, how much it increased or decreased in terms of percentage.
-----------------------------
Formula: (2014 sales/ 2013 sales)-1
-----------------------------
-> So at any random box, we'l  calculate it.
-> type = , then select the 2014 sales value , -> then put this divided by symbol / -> then select the 2013 sales value-> put the whole thing in bracket -> then put -1.
-> the formula would look like:=(GETPIVOTDATA("Sum of Sales",$A$3,"Years",2014)/GETPIVOTDATA("Sum of Sales",$A$3,"Years",2013))-1
-> then Enter
->Similarly take out for Profit, Quantity, Order ID, Profit Margin.
------------------------------------------------------------
-> Now we'll have to give it's colour Combination-> +ve -> then upward arrow & green , negative , then-> downward arrow & red.
->So,select the first calculated YOY value,-> then Ctrl+1 -> then Custom -> Type: [Green]▲0.00%;[Red] ▼0.00%
->Ok-> Green Appeared-> To give it to all the values-> select this coloured value-> go to -> home-> then Format Painter-> then extend it to all the values.
-> We'll change the all the coloured values font to Lato Black, by selecting all the values-> then above-> Calibri -> to Lato Black.
(-> For the arrow(or traingle) symbols(above),-> go to Insert-> Symbols->Symbol-> here we can find it. But we'll google upward arrow for yoy, we'll get it.)
------------------------------------------------------------
-> Now all our designs are ready, just we will do it's layouts and the placing of it.
-> Again go to Data sheet , insert-> pivot table-> new worksheet-> Ok -> Name it: Dashboard
-> For a background, search on google-> black texture background
->Downloaded: 1489205.jpg
-> After downloading, got to-> Page Layout->Background-> Browse and select.
-> After this go to View-> Grid Lines->Uncheck it. Aslo uncheck the headings.
---------------------------
Go to Insert-> Illustrations -> Shapes -> Select the Polygon type shape(after the triangle)
->Design it accordingly as shown and use Lato Black Font.-> Centre the fonts accordingly by clicking in the icons above.
-> To put the KPI's inside the shape, first select the shape,-> go to formula bar -> type = to-> go to KPI sheet->select the grand total value of the sales, which is outside the pivot table in $.IMPORTANT. -> then ENTER.
-> Font LATO BLACK-> FONT WHITE colour
-> For the spark line, do CTRL+C and ctrl+v in dashboard.
-> For another value(here YOY growth), do ctrl+hold and drag below(for copy) for another shape .
-> Select all the shapes(here 4 shapes)-> right click on it-> format object->Line->No line-> i.e we will erase the border.
-> Then again, select all the 4 shapes-> right click-> FOrmat object-> fill-> Gradient fill-> now remove(delete) the two stops in between in the gradient i.e select and delete-> now give colours to both the remaining stops.
-> angle 20 degree
-> 1st stop's transparency-> 20%
-> 2nd stop's transparency -> 25%
-> Now, select the chart i.e containing the spark line(whole), right click on the chart, ->Click on Format Chart Area-> Fill-> No Fill.
-> Then ,in same Format Chart area-> Border-> No line
-> Again select chart-> format chart area->in chart options(above)-> select series options-> Line->colour change to grey.-> increase the line's width to 2.75 pt.
-> For putting the YOY growth, in the KPI YOY sheet-> select the first green value-> Ctrl +C-> Come to the dashboard-> select any cell , -> in Home->to paste, there are several options-> In other Paste Options->Select the last Option.(By selecting this option, what we copied, this creates a picture of it, now we can treat it as picture)(It will dynamic)
-> On the title, Ecommerce Revenue, it's gradient change-> For this->select the whole long shape->Right click->Format shape->Gradient fill-> Now it will automatically take the gradient we selected.
-> Now rightclick on it again->Line-> No line.
-------------------------
-> Now select all the 4 shapes-> right click-> group->Group.(now it will become a single object)
-> Now press ctrl + and then drag and make 5 similar kpis.
-> Now change the names of the respective kpi's
-> nOW FOR CHANGING THE dollar value of each of them , select the box-> in the formula delete it-> type = ->then in KPI sheet-> copy the 2nd table's dollar value -> enter.Similarly, do it for all of them.
-> For font , select lato Black-> 16 font->white colour.(all of them)
----------------------------
-> for spark line, copy them from KPI sheet and paste them in Dashboard.->select the chart->right click-> Format chart area->Fill->no fill, then -> border-> No line
-> Now click on it's colour-> right click-> format data series-> series options-> change colour and change width to 2.75pt(do it for all of them)
----------------------------
-> in the first kpi-> the chart has very light colour (since we didn't take the chart on our grouping)-> so right click it-> send to back.
-> Similarly, bring back all the YOY values,-> first copy it from KPI YOY,->then Dashboard->paste-> Other paste options->4th option.
-------------------------------
-> Now select all the objects and beake it into a single group-> select all the KPIs-> right click-> group-> group.
------------------------------
-> Kpis completed
-> Now same , insert-> illustrations-> shapes-> Polygon.
-> To sharp the edges-> click on the orange dots on the image
-> then right click it-> format shape->Line -> No line-> Fill-> Gradient Fill-> and it will automatically take the gradient colour.
-> Now ctrl+ drag to make these 5 positions
->Layouting done
-------------------------------
-> Now for the title, same , insert-> illustrations-> shapes-> Polygon.-> Ctrl + drag for 5 such boxes for writing the titles.
-> right click-> ForMAT SHAPE-> FILL->gRADIENT FILL, THEN->LINE->NO LINE. cHANGE THE COLOUR SLIGHTLY FOR THIS GRADIENT , CHANGE THE COLOUR FOR THE SECOND STOP ONLY.
->Ctrl+drag for all the title boxes.

-> rightclick and then group the third row.
--------------------------------
-> Now copy the combo chart and paste it in the first box.
-> Select the chart , on the + icon -> go to legend-> click on top.
-> again select and right click the chart-> Format chart area -> fill-> no fill-> , then no line.
-> Then make the letters white colour but selcting them and color it(above).
-> To remove the .00 in the axes ,->right click on the axis-> format axis-> Number->Format code-> remove .00 -> add
-> similarly do for the other axis.
-> To change the colour of the chart->select the chart->right click-> Format chart area->chart options->Series "Sumof profit"-> Color->Blue
-> select the chart->right click-> Format chart area->chart options->Series "Sumof sales"-> click on the bar icon-> decrease gapwidth to 59%. then again go on first icon -> fill -> color -> white
