ignore__tableau:

Connect to data-> Microsoft excel file-> click on it , and open the data.

-> Select the HR data(excel file) and open it on Tableau.

-> What you see small table at the left, at the end is Metadata

-> And the big table, at the right -> here you can edit the data or change the data (some modifications) in the table here

-> Below click Sheet 1 -> and rename it as KPI.

-> In Tableau original desktop app, at the top right, you will see there is Live connection , and one is Extract Connection.

-> If there is a large amount of data, say millions of inputs are there, then use Extract connection, since it gives us the liberty to work offline.
-> In Live connection, we have to be online, and it should be connected to a database continuously.
->But When sharing with your friends , you go with extract connection, save it as TWBX file which is a package workbook file, where data will be there, logic will be there, and your workbook will be there.

--------------------------------------------
-> So now to design KPI's:

-> Drag the Employee count table on left, and put it on Text.

-> It will output:1470 , since we have 1470 rows, and for each row employee count is 1.
-> So if we see on Data Source (below left), the employee count table , actually it will give us the sum, but as there is one employee in each row, so count is 1470.
------------------
->Next we want is Attrition. How much attrition is there?
-> First column is Attrition(in Data Source):
If it says Yes-(using 1) then the particular employee has left the company.
If it says No-(using 0) then the particular employee is still working in the company.

-> So, wherever there is Yes, we'll take a sum of those and we'll display it as our 2nd KPI. i.e how many people has left the  company.

-> So go to the KPI sheet, above the Tables, there is a small downward arrow, click on it. -> then create calculated field
-> Name it as Attrition Count (it should be a unique than what is in the columns)
-> Formula: IF [Attrition]='Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
-> THen press OK
-> Now see on left a new  table will be added named: Attrition Count
(there will be a small = symbol before the name of it, it means we calculated it manually).
-> Now when we double click on Attrition Count, it will be added to our KPI.
-> Now The Attrition Count and Employee Count we got is in row-wise.
-> So,Now above where it is written ,rows and columns, there is a swap symbol , click it to swap it to column-wise.
-> We want the employee count first, so -> in measured values-> drag the employee count to first.(i.e above the attrition count)
-> And from where standard is written make it to Entire View.(to fit in the entire screen)
------------------------
-> Next we have to find is Attrition Rate.
LOGIC: TOTAL ATTRITION/ TOTAL EMPLOYEE COUNT
->Click on that  downard arrow-> Create calculated field -> Name it as: Attrition Rate
-> Formula: SUM([Attrition Count])/ SUM([Employee Count])
-> Now double click, or drag the Attrition Rate to MEasured VAlues.
-> It will be showing zero right now.
-> So, now right click Attrition rate-> Format -> then Numbers-> then Percentage -> Decimal Places :2 ->Show in Attrition Rate it shows some number.
---------------------------------------------
-> Now, Active Employees
-> For Active Employee = Employee count- Attrition Count
-> For this: Again Click on Downward Arrow->
