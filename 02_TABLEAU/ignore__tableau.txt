ignore__tableau:

Connect to data-> Microsoft excel file-> click on it , and open the data.

-> Select the HR data(excel file) and open it on Tableau.

-> What you see small table at the left, at the end is Metadata

-> And the big table, at the right -> here you can edit the data or change the data (some modifications) in the table here

-> Below click Sheet 1 -> and rename it as KPI.

-> In Tableau original desktop app, at the top right, you will see there is Live connection , and one is Extract Connection.

-> If there is a large amount of data, say millions of inputs are there, then use Extract connection, since it gives us the liberty to work offline.
-> In Live connection, we have to be online, and it should be connected to a database continuously.
->But When sharing with your friends , you go with extract connection, save it as TWBX file which is a package workbook file, where data will be there, logic will be there, and your workbook will be there.

--------------------------------------------
-> So now to design KPI's:

-> Drag the Employee count table on left, and put it on Text.

-> It will output:1470 , since we have 1470 rows, and for each row employee count is 1.
-> So if we see on Data Source (below left), the employee count table , actually it will give us the sum, but as there is one employee in each row, so count is 1470.
------------------
->Next we want is Attrition. How much attrition is there?
-> First column is Attrition(in Data Source):
If it says Yes-(using 1) then the particular employee has left the company.
If it says No-(using 0) then the particular employee is still working in the company.

-> So, wherever there is Yes, we'll take a sum of those and we'll display it as our 2nd KPI. i.e how many people has left the  company.

-> So go to the KPI sheet, above the Tables, there is a small downward arrow, click on it. -> then create calculated field
-> Name it as Attrition Count (it should be a unique than what is in the columns)
-> Formula: IF [Attrition]='Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
-> THen press OK
-> Now see on left a new  table will be added named: Attrition Count
(there will be a small = symbol before the name of it, it means we calculated it manually).
-> Now when we double click on Attrition Count, it will be added to our KPI.
-> Now The Attrition Count and Employee Count we got is in row-wise.
-> So,Now above where it is written ,rows and columns, there is a swap symbol , click it to swap it to column-wise.
-> We want the employee count first, so -> in measured values-> drag the employee count to first.(i.e above the attrition count)
-> And from where standard is written make it to Entire View.(to fit in the entire screen)
------------------------
-> Next we have to find is Attrition Rate.
LOGIC: TOTAL ATTRITION/ TOTAL EMPLOYEE COUNT
->Click on that  downard arrow-> Create calculated field -> Name it as: Attrition Rate
-> Formula: SUM([Attrition Count])/ SUM([Employee Count])
-> Now double click, or drag the Attrition Rate to MEasured VAlues.
-> It will be showing zero right now.
-> So, now right click Attrition rate-> Format -> then Numbers-> then Percentage -> Decimal Places :2 ->Show in Attrition Rate it shows some number.
---------------------------------------------
-> Now, Active Employees
-> For Active Employee = Employee count- Attrition Count
-> For this: Again Click on Downward Arrow-> Name it as : Active Employees
FORMULA: SUM([Employee Count])-SUM([Attrition Count])
-> Then click on OK-> Then Double click on it, in the Tables section.
-> We want the Active Employees , after the Attrition RAte, so drag it to the last.
------------------------
Now for the last kpi, we want average age.
->Search for age in the above search bar above tables.
-> Double click on it.
-> In the Measure Values, we see it is taking SUM (Age),(by default) but we want average.
-> For that,right click on green SUM(Age) -> Measure(SUM) -> Average
----------------------------------------------------
-> Now we'll change the format of the fields that we are having.(the green boxes i.e measure values)
-> Right Click on SUM(Employee Count) -> Format-> (see above left)Numbers-> Number(Custom)-> Decimal Places:0

-> Lets' add one filter to check it:
-> Search Education on the search box -> Then drag it under the Filters.-> Then       use all-> Apply-> Ok
-> Now right click on Education(blue)-> Show filters-> Then at the right it will be shown.
-> Now when you apply the filter , we see different decimal points on different KPIs. So we want to make it uniform.

(-> Changing the format so as to make it constant throughout, otherwise , if we dont do these, then in some result it will show two decimal points, somewhere three, and so on. So we don't want this, so we'll make it round figure.)(It doesn't happen when we use the Interactive filters, but does happen when we will be using the Action Filters)
-> Again Right Click on SUM(Attrition Count) -> Format-> Numbers(see above left)-> Number(Custom)-> Decimal Places:0
-> Leave the Attrition Rate, as we want it in Percentage only.
-> Again Right Click on SUM(Active Employees) -> Format-> Numbers(see above left)-> Number(Custom)-> Decimal Places:0
-> Again Right Click on AVG(Age) -> Format-> Numbers(see above left)-> Number(Custom)-> Decimal Places:0
--------------------------------------------------
-> The filter that we created will be used for all the charts from now.

-> So,Right click on the Education Filter, -> Then Apply to Worksheets-> All using this data source
(-> means whenever we will be designing any sheet further , the default filter will be automatically applied.Because we made it at a data source level.)
----------------------------------------------------
-> Next chart will be LOLLIPOP CHART. It will be a custom chart.

-> Select a new sheet from bottom -> Name it as : Attrition By Gender
-> This chart will give insight for: wrt male and female , how many people are leaving the company.
-> Search for gender, then drag it and put in on Rows(above).
-> Then search for Attrition Count calculation, which we made before, then drag it in the COlumns(above).
-> So, we see we got a bar chart.
-> Above from Standard, make it-> Entire View.
-> To make this chart a Lollipop Chart, we have to make a circle at the tip.
-> So, to add that circle, we have to make it as Dual Axis Chart.
-> To make it as a Dual Axis Chart, In the Columns, there is SUM(Attrition Count) , press ctrl + and drag it on right to make another instance of it.
-> In the left, In Marks Card, also TWO INSTANCES have been created.
-> So in MArks card-> in the second major-> SUM(Attrition By Gender)-> Click on the downward arrow, make it as Circle.
-> Now, for dual axis chart, in the columns(above), SUM(Attrition Count) (the Second Major) , right click on it ->Dual Axis.

-> Now in the Marks column-> in SUM(Attrition Count) (the first major) -> Change the automatic  to Bar.

-> In Attrition By Gender, where in the right of Gender, the axis of Attrition Count is there, right click on it -> Then Synchronize Axis. 
(Since, for both majors, different axis will be created.(but since here we are using same majors, so no  difference will be seen)So, whenever we will be working with two different majors, and will work on a Dual Axis Chart, remember that we have to always synchronize the axis.)

-> In Marks, in Second MAjor,-> SUM(Attrition Count)  -> In size -> Increase The size.

-> In Marks, in First MAjor,-> SUM(Attrition Count)  -> In size -> Decrease The size.

-> Now to give these colours,-> Search for Gender in search box.
-> Drag the Gender in the First MAjor in the Marks Column and put it into Colour.
->Again, Drag the Gender in the Second MAjor in the Marks Column and put it into Colour.

-> Now,to change the colours to our own custom colours :
-> Go to the first MAjor in MArks Column-> SUM(Attrition COunt)-> Colour-> EDit colour-> Double click on Female-> In HTML; give the colour code: #ffbb78 or select your own colour.
For male-> COlour code:#9467bd

->In the columns(above)-> Click on the send major i.e SUM(Count Attrition) , -> Press ctrl + (TO create one more instance)and drag it to the Marks column in the second major-> SUM(Attrition COunt) -> Label

-> Again Click on the Label there-> GO to Automatic -> in the first row, first column-> Make it at the center.
---------------------------------------------
Now we'll start creating our Dashboard Side by Side.
-> For this at the bottom, click on the 4 squared + button -> Then rename Dashboard 1 -> to HR Attrition Analysis.

-> We'll be using custom size for our dashboard. -> Change it to 1580 by 900.
-> For this-> in left side-> in Size-> do it FIxed Size-> do it 1580 and in height 900.

-> Now for the background image -> Go to the link given for the sample background in POwerpoint.-> When PPT is opened-> Go to file-> Go to Save As-> Save Desktop or anywhere -> Then Save it as a PNG Format.

-> Now, in Tableau, in left, -> In Objects-> Image-> Drag the image to the center of the screen.-> Then tick both Fit Image and Center Image.
-> There choose your image , then -> Ok -> Ok.
-> Now we'll be taking our sheets and placing it in this dashboard.

-> For that, first in Objects(below)-> Click on FLoating.(by doing this we can move our chart from here to there)(Tiles is for when you will be placed in that container-> and you cant change the size of the chart)

-> Drag the KPI in sheets and place it in the second row in the dashboard.
-> Right click on the above transparent portion in the kpi , in dashboard, when dragged.
-> THen click Hide Title.-> Then make the KPI fit in the second row.
-> Now in DAshboard sheet, Now right click on the Employee count (the word) -> Then click Format -> Font Tableau Semi Bold -> Then yellow colour-> Font size: 15

-> Alignment: Center
-> Since we want the backgound of it as No background. For this: right click on Employee Count(the word)-> Format-> Below the Forat Font , there are 5 icons. Click on the 3 icon (for shading).
-> In Deafult-> WOrksheet-> Make it None. Also make all the things that you see below as none.
-> In Format Shading -> In Sheet, Row, Column select all as None.

-> Now , got to KPI Sheet -> in Marks -> in Text -> click on the three dots->
-> Then the the word <Measure Values>  -> Then
-> Change it as font style: Tableau Bold-> font size: 28->Colour White -> Apply -> OK
-> Again in Marks-> Automatic-> Click on Text-> Alignment: Center.
-> Now go to the dashboard to see that it is applied.
-----------------------------------------------
-> Now, in the dashboard sheet, in the left side :from Sheets drag Attrition by gender, to the middle.
-> In the dragged thing, double click on the title-> edit title-> select the text: <Sheet Name>
-> Font size:12, Tableau SemiBold , colour-> Yellow.
-> Then in that only, in the right-> right click in the axis->uncheck the Show Header.(to get rid of the axis)-> Again do this for the below axis also.
-> Now right click on Gender in it-> Hide Field Labels For Rows.
-> Now put it in that small box.
-> If the size of the lollipop is not what you anted-> Go to the Attrition By Gender sheet. In Marks-> in first major: SUM(Attrition Count)-> In SIze.-> For the bar size and in the second major below for the circle size.
-> Now in Dashboard sheet-> right click on the Female in the dashboard-> then Format-> then in Shading(icon) in left; in Sheet -> Worksheet -> None.
-> No, again click on the  white Lines in the Chart, to get rid of it.
-> Now, in Left in the fifth icon-> Format Lines-> in SHeets , Rows, and Columns, all do None.
-> tO REMOVE THE BORDERS AROUND THIS CHART->in left click the 4th icon->i.e Format Borders-> In rows-> select everything as none.-> In columns also, make everything as NOne.

-> Now, here to fix the font, click on female, got to the left and click on the firt icon i.e Format Font-> In Sheet-> Header->White Colour, there only-> font size :8 , then FOnt: Tableau Medium.
-> For giving the Dashboard name: (in Left) -> In objects-> drag the Text in the dashboard.->Write it: HR ATTRITION ANALYTICS. Edit it: Select the text->size: 36-> colour: white

-> Go to the Attrition By Gender Sheet->Tables-> Multiple-> Label-> click on three dots->Select the text and make it as size: 9. black, Tableau Semibold.
